# UnitTestingDotNet8
Welcome to the Unit Testing with xUnit repository! This repository focuses on demonstrating best practices and techniques for unit testing using the xUnit framework in .NET.

# Introduction
Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation. The goal is to validate that each unit of the software performs as expected. xUnit is a popular unit testing framework for .NET applications that provides a robust set of tools and capabilities for writing and executing tests.

# Types of Testing

### Unit Testing 
Unit testing verifies the smallest parts of a software application, typically individual classes or methods, in isolation from the rest of the system. It ensures that each unit performs as intended according to its design.

### Integration Testing
Integration testing checks how individual units work together as a group. It focuses on interactions between various components or modules to ensure they integrate correctly and function as expected as a whole.

### Functional Testing
Functional testing evaluates the complete functionality of a software application against its requirements. It verifies that the software behaves correctly from a user's perspective, including its inputs, outputs, and interactions with external systems.

# Sharing Test Contexts with xUnit

### Constructor and Dispose
xUnit allows sharing setup and cleanup logic across multiple test methods using the constructor and IDisposable interface. This approach ensures that resources are properly initialized before tests and cleaned up afterward, maintaining a clean test environment.

### IClassFixture
IClassFixture in xUnit enables sharing setup and teardown code across tests within the same class. It allows the creation of a fixture class that provides shared context or resources needed by multiple tests.

### CollectionFixture
CollectionFixture allows sharing setup and cleanup logic across multiple test classes. It groups tests that require shared state or external resources into a cohesive unit, ensuring consistency and efficiency in testing.

# Additional xUnit Framework Utilities
In addition to sharing test contexts, xUnit provides various utilities and features such as:

### Assertions: Assert methods to verify expected conditions and outcomes in tests.
